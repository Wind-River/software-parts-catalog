        Maintaining a catalog of software components (parts) is a requirement
        whether generating SBOMs for managing license compliance, security
        assurance, export control, or safety certification. We developed a
        highly searchable scalable software parts database (catalog) enabling
        companies to seamlessly manage 1000s, 10,000s if not 100,000s of
        software parts from which their products are comprised.
